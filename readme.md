# Muscle POS  
A **standalone handheld Point-of-Sale (POS) system** built for small retail businesses. Unlike traditional POS solutions that depend heavily on smartphones or constant internet connectivity, **Muscle POS** is designed to be **offline-first, durable, and affordable**, with optional cloud synchronization.

## 📌 Project Overview  

During the early design and development phases, multiple approaches were considered:  

### 🔹 Architecture Alternatives  

- **Option A: Full Cloud-based System**  
  - ✅ Real-time sync, advanced analytics  
  - ❌ High data costs, requires constant internet  
  - **Decision:** Rejected  

- **Option B: Smartphone App**  
  - ✅ Easy updates, leverages existing hardware  
  - ❌ Device dependency, drains battery  
  - **Decision:** Rejected  

- **Option C: Standalone Handheld Device** **(SELECTED)**  
  - ✅ Purpose-built, offline-capable, affordable  
  - ❌ Requires custom hardware development  

👉 **Final Choice:** A **custom standalone handheld device** tailored for offline operations, with optional cloud sync when internet is available.
